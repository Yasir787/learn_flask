I have added code to demonstrate dynamic rendering in Flask. 

After completing the code, follow these steps:

1. Run the Python app using the command:
    ```
    python app.py
    ```
2. Open your browser and navigate to:
    ```
    http://127.0.0.1:5000/user/<user_name>
    ```
    For example:
    ```
    http://127.0.0.1:5000/user/yasir
    ```
